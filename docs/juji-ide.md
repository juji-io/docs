# **Juji Interactive Development Environment (IDE)**


The Juji platform has many built-in capabilities for creating powerful
conversational AI assistants. When your needs go beyond these built-in
capabilities, Juji put in your hands a simple yet expressive chatbot
scripting language, called [REP (Responsible and
Empathetic Persona) langauge](../reference), so that you can harness the full power
of the Juji platform.

Juji IDE provides an interactive development environment that allows
  chatbot developers to write, compile, and preview AI chatbots using
  the REP language. Juji IDE is suitable for people with minimal
  coding skills (e.g., can write HTML) to power AI chatbots with
  advanced capabilities (e.g., customizing product recommendation
  policies).

## Work with REP Scripts

In the IDE, you have access to an online scripting environment. To
access the IDE page, you can click on the red round button at the bottom left corner of the
[Chatbot Design](../juji-studio/design) window in [Juji Studio](../juji-studio).

<p align="center"><img src="../img/ide-button.png" alt="IDE button" width="650"/></p>

### File Browser

On the left side of the environment, you have a file browser showing all your scripts
and config files. The files are organized by the bot applications you have
created, each called an `Engagement`.

Each `Engagement` contains a `Config` document, which reflects the [Design
View](../design) of the bot; a `Preivew` release, which has the script powering
the preview chat; and a number of `Web`, `Facebook`, or `Slack` releases, which
are your production releases of the bot scripts.

### Code Editor

On the right side of the environment, there is a code editor containing the file
you select in the file browser. The editor has syntax highlighting, rainbow
parentheses, and brackets mismatch errors are detected on the fly while you are typing.

#### Custom script file

The custom script file has a namespace ending in `.custom`. Such a file is where
your custom topics are saved. You can also freely write your own topics and
functions in that file.

You can `Upload` a file to replace the file, or `Download` the file to your
local disk, or `Save` the file in the Juji platform.

#### Main script file

The main script file of a release has a namespace ending in something like
`.web2`, where `web` the name of the release channel, and `2` means the second
release of this engagement in that channel.

In addition to `Upload`, `Download`, and `Save`, the main script also supports
`Compile` and `Preview` functionality, where you can see your script in action
immediately.

#### Config document

This document shows the high level structure and content of your engagement.
Sometimes it is easier to edit content in the config document rather than in the
script files.

When click `Generate Script` pull down menu, a new release can directly be
created right there.

## Add Self-Defined (Complex) FAQs

While you can always use the GUI in Juji Studio to add FAQs
(../design#customize-qa-and-fallback), you may have already prepared
answers to some frequently asked questions that you want to import
into the script. Juji provides a command line tool for you to convert
the FAQ and answers into REP script snippets, and you can then paste
them into your script in IDE.

Before you start, please make sure you have installed Java 6 or higher and you are familiar with general [concepts](concept.md) of Juji script.

### Step 1: Prepare the FAQ CSV File

Your self-defined FAQs need to be written in a csv file satisfying the following format requirements:

1. The first column lists the questions.
2. The second column lists the corresponding answers of the first column's questions.
3. One row can only have one answer. But there can be multiple questions in the same row, which means these questions share the same answer. Basically, these are different examples of the same question. These example questions should be separated by newline characters.
4. The first row is assumed to be the header.

Here's an <a href="../faq-parser/example-faqs.csv">example FAQ csv file</a>.

The ability of Juji bot to recognize FAQs depends on the number of example questions you give. So it is recommended that you give multiple forms of the same question as examples.

Once you have prepared your FAQ and answers in the above format, do the following two steps to import them:

### Step 2: Convert the FAQ File to a `deftopic`

In order to convert FAQs to a deftopic, please download the command line tool in the form of a jar file: <a href="../faq-parser/faq-parser-0.1.0.jar">faqs-parser jar</a>. Then you can convert your FAQs by running the following command:

```
java -jar faq-parser-0.1.0.jar <path/to/your-faq-csv-file>
```

You can also run the program with the help option to see all possible options.

```
java -jar faq-parser-0.1.0.jar -h
```

Running the faq-parser produces an edn file containing one deftopic.

For instance, running the faq-parser without any option on our example FAQ csv file would produce the following `deftopic` using a default name `generated-faq-topic`:

```clojure
(deftopic
 generated-faq-topic
 []
 [(>
   (max-similarity-score
    ["where does your company locate?"
     "what's your address?"
     "where is your office?"])
   0.75)]
 ["We are located in San Jose, California."]
 [(>
   (max-similarity-score
    ["how frequently do you carry out maintenance?"])
   0.75)]
 ["We carry out maintenance once a month."]
 [(> (max-similarity-score ["how can i try your service?"]) 0.75)]
 ["Our service is currently free to try. Please visit our website at juji.io to create an account and try to build your own chatbot in 10 minutes."])
```

### Step 3: Paste the `deftopic` into your script in IDE

Once you have your csv file converted, you need to copy the `deftopic` form from the edn file into your main chat script. You can paste it anywhere that has the same global scope as other `deftopic`s.

Then, in your script, find the `:ad-lib` key and its vector value in `(config ...)`, and add the name of the `deftopic` to be the first item in that vector. By putting your deftopic at the beginning of the `:ad-lib` vector, the REP will check it before all other FAQs. On the other hand, you can generate multiple FAQ topics and place them in the `:ad-lib` vector in the order you desired.

Following our previous example in step 2, below is a screenshot of adding the generated deftopic `generated-faq-topic` to a script and add the topic name to the script's `:ad-lib` vector:

<p align="center"><img src="../img/add-generated-faq-topic.png" alt="IDE faq" width="600"/></p>

At this point, you may save and compile the script. Now your self-defined FAQs are added to your chatbot.

## Chatbot Scripting Resources

To use Juji IDE effectively and efficiently, you may also want to check out
the following resources, which can help you write scripts, extend chatbot capabilities, and integrate Juji chatbots with third-party systems.

### [Juji Concepts](../concept)

Unlike other chatbot platforms, Juji chatbots' built-in intelligence relies on several key concepts, such as conversation topics and automated dialog management.

### [Juji Built-in Dialog Library](../topics)

Unlike other chatbot platforms, Juji has a rich dialog library, consisting of many mini-conversations, known as built-in topics. Such topics can be directly used or customized to assemble a chatbot rapidly.

### Juji Functions

To extend the capabilities of Juji chatbots, such as connecting them with third-party systems or resources, you can use Juji functions. There are two types of functions:

* [System Functions](../function)
* [User-Defined Functions](../udf)
