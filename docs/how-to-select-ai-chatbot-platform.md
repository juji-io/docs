# **Which AI Chatbot Platform to Use?** <a name="right-platform"></a>

For individuals and organizations who are unfamiliar with the
development of conversational AI solutions, this seems like a daunting
question to answer because there are hundreds if not thousands of
chatbot options available out there.

Like adopting a child, investing in a chatbot solution is not a light
decision nor a short-term investment. We would like to share with you
the tips on whether and how to make a wise AI investment. In
particular, we recommend three quick rounds of due diligence plus a
deep dive.

## **Round 1: Decide on whether you'd need a chatbot at all**

Just like making any investment, it's always good to start with a justifiable
investment rationale and a clear investment goal. The same principle
should also be applied to a chatbot investment.
First, [use this quick assessment](https://juji.io/blog/do-you-really-need-an-ai-chatbot-use-these-3-questions-to-decide/) to decide whether it is worth investing in a chatbot solution. 

## **Round 2: Decide on which type of chatbot you'd need**

Once you decide that you do want to invest in an AI chatbot solution,
a simple Google search will present you with hundreds if not thousands
of AI chatbot platforms! Almost all of them claim that they are
powered by generative AI and all seem to offer similar features,
giving the first impression that any of them would do the job.

In reality, not every chatbot platform is created equal or is a
perfect fit for the chatbot solution you have in mind. For example,
many of our customers mentioned to us before they found Juji, they had
explored 20+ chatbot platforms but failed to find the one that meets
their needs.

To help you expedite your chatbot platform selection process, in this
round, we help you identify the type of chatbots you need
before diving into the nitty-gritty details of an AI chatbot
platform. This step is utterly important since different types of chatbots
require different types of technologies and support, which in turn
affects the type and size of investment you'd need to make.

### 1. Q﻿uestion-Answering Chatbots (QA Chatbots)

The main task for these chatbots is to answer user questions based on
public and/or proprietary information. For example, universities may
use a chatbot on their website to answer student questions about
learning programs (see Image 1.1 below), or hospitals may use a
chatbot in their mobile app to answer patient questions on medical
services. Very similar to the behavior of ChatGPT, this type of
chatbot is typically driven by user questions and assumes that all
questions can be answered in a SINGLE response, which is not the case
in many real-world applications.

### 2﻿. Question-Asking Chatbots (Survey/Interview Chatbots)

The main task for these chatbots is to ask user questions and gather
information from an intended audience. Very similar to an online
survey, this type of chatbot has been used to gather information for
research studies, personality assessments, and job interviews (Image
1.2 provides an example of an interview chatbot). Typically, this type
of chatbot is NOT capable of answering user questions including
clarification questions during the process.

### 3﻿. Proactive, Two-Way Conversational Chatbots (Proactive Chatbots)

In real-world applications, chatbots often need to perform multiple
tasks simultaneously to deliver desired user experience and accomplish
the business objectives. For example, a QA-only chatbot on a
university website may be inadequate because the same chatbot must
also ask questions to gather necessary information from the visitors
before it can answer their questions (see Image 1.3 below). Similarly,
a survey-only chatbot for job interviews may be unsatisfactory because
it must also answer candidate questions regarding the positions and
the organization during the interview. This third type of chatbot is a
hybrid of the QA and survey chatbots, capable of both asking and
answering questions during a conversation, known as Proactive
Chatbots.

## **Round 3: Evaluate AI Chatbot Platforms by the Type of Chatbot Needed**

Once you decide the type of AI chatbot you need, you can then use the relevant
chatbot KPIs to evaluate AI chatbot platforms. Below lists the chatbot KPIs relevant to each type of chatbot.

## **Take a Deep Dive: Compare Chatbot Options by 3 Factors**

The the first 3 rounds could help you quickly decide whether it is
worth investing in an AI chatbot solution and weed out most of the
chatbot options that will not help you fulfill your chatbot goals. Assume now
that you have 3-5 chatbot platforms to do a deep dive on. We recommend
that you evaluate and compare these selected platforms along three
factors as listed below.

### **I. User Experience and Business ROI**

A chatbot or conversational AI agent is meant to scale out human-human
engagements (e.g., university enrollment counselors with prospective
students and college academic advisors with existing students). Since
a chatbot acts on the behalf of an organization, a key criterion to
evaluate a chatbot platform is to assess how well a chatbot engages
with a user and delivers satisfactory user experience while
maximizing business ROI, such as improving prospective student
conversion and existing student retention rate. When evaluating how
well a chatbot option can deliver satisfactory user experience and
business ROI, you want to compare available chatbot options on the
following aspects:

* How well can a chatbot drive an empathetic and
  productive two-way conversation?

* How well can a chatbot deeply understand the psychographic
  characteristics (e.g., interests, unspoken needs, and personality)
  of its users from the conversations and use such insights to
  personalize machine or human advices?

### **II. Time to Value and Cost of Ownership**

If not careful, investing in a chatbot solution could become a
nightmare as if investing in a bottomless pit that requires constant
new investments (e.g., time and money) but with little return
of value. To avoid the pitfalls, it is important to deep dive into
chatbot options and compare the following:

* How much AI training do I need to do up front to teach a
  chatbot before it can function and deliver value for me?

* What kind of customizations are supported?

* What resources are required to do the customization (e.g., non-IT subject
  matter experts, dedicated IT personnel, or professional services)?

* How long will it take to make all the customizations?

* How do I test, iteratively improve, and deploy a chatbot solution?
  How easy and fast can I do this?

* What kind of reporting and analytics are available for me to access?
  Are they real-time data?

* How can I monitor and maintain or upgrade my chatbot? Will the
  maintanence or upgrades interrupt ongoing conversations?

### **III. Enterprise-Scale Adaptibility and Extensibility**

When an organization adopts a chatbot solution, it is often the case
that the organization wishes to build upon the current solution and
support new users of the chatbot. Thus it is important to evaluate
whether such a solution can be easily and quickly adapted to support
new tasks or be extended to support multiple tasks. For example, when
an educational institute starts with a chatbot solution to support
student recruitment, it may want to extend the chatbot to help
prospective students in their application process. Likewise, the
educational institute may want to add additional chatbots to help
student retention or alumni engagement. To evaluate how quickly and
easily a chatbot solution can be easily extended or reused in whole or
partially to support new tasks, ask the following:

* How quickly and easily can I reuse and adapt an existing chatbot to support a new task?

* How quickly and easily can I reuse and adapt an existing chatbot to
  support multiple tasks?

* How can I reuse just part of a chatbot (e.g., Q&A only) in another
  chatbot?

* How can I connect a chatbot to external resources, such as CMS or CRM system?

* How can I extend a chatbot with external functions (e.g., my own
  algorithms or third-party functions such as language translations)?

* How can I white-label a chatbot or embed a chatbot into my
  propreitary solutions?


## **Build Your Own Chatbot Comparison Table**

To help your Round-2 evaluation of multiple chatbot options, we have
created a set of detailed comparison criteria by the 3 factors
mentioned above:

* [User Experience and Business
ROI](#i-user-experience-and-business-roi)

* [Time to Value and Cost of Ownership](#ii-time-to-value-and-cost-of-ownership)

* [Enterprise-Scale Adaptability and
Extensibility](#iii-enterprise-scale-adaptibility-and-extensibility)


For your convenience, we list all the evaluation dimensions in a
table below, supplemented with concrete examples wherever possible to
help explain each evaluation dimension. While we use building an
educational chatbot solution as an example, the evaluation criteria
should be broadly applicable for building any chatbot solutions.

You can also [download the comparison template in an Excel
file](./files/Compare-Chatbot-Options-Template.xlsx) to build your
own comparison sheet and evaluate different chatbot options by
checking off each dimension for each chatbot option.
