# **Which AI Chatbot Platform to Use?** <a name="right-platform"></a>

For individuals and organizations who are unfamiliar with the development of conversational AI solutions, this seems like a daunting question to answer because there are hundreds or thousands of chatbot options available out there.

Investing in a chatbot solution is not a light decision or short-term
investment. We would like to share with you two rounds of due diligence that
you could perform to evaluate various chatbot options and then decide
on which chatbot option or platform would suit your needs the best.

## **Round 1: Prescreen a chatbot option**

Before diving into the nitty-gritty details of a chatbot platform, use
the following questions to do a quick prescreening of available
chatbot options. This process is relatively quick and easy, which
should save you a ton of time by quickly weeding out the unhelpful ones.  

!!! question "Does the platform use its own chatbot to serve its own business, ideally in the same solution that you wish to have?"
    In other words, do they trust their own product enough to dogfood it?

If the answer to the above question is `yes`, ask:

!!! question "How do you like your interaction experience with the featured chatbot?"
    Concretely, ask the following:

    * Whether and how well does it understand your free-text input?
    * Whether and how well does it address your questions and handle your interruptions?
    * Whether and how well does it help you achieve your task?

    Keep in mind that this is perhaps one of their better chatbots. It's most likely that if you don't like the interaction experience, it would be very difficult for you to build a chatbot on their platform with which your users would enjoy interacting.  

If the answers to the above questions are all positive, ask:

!!! question "How fast can you use the platform to create a simple AI chatbot yourself?" 
    Just make a simple chatbot to demonstrate the following:

    * Make your chatbot ask user an open-ended question (e.g., `Could you introduce yourself?`)
    * Ask chatbot a general question before responding to the chatbot's asking (e.g., `What kind of questions can you answer`)
    * Observe how the chatbot responds to your input and note what you like or dislike

If the platform does not allow you to DIY such a simple AI chatbot described above, ask:

!!! question "How long will take the platform provider to do it for you?"

If the answers to all the above questions are positive to you, the platform might be worth a deeper look as described below. 

## **Round 2: Compare Chatbot Options by 3 Factors**

The pre-screening stage could typically help you weed out most of the
chatbot options. Assume now that you have 3-5 chatbot platforms to do
a deep dive on. We recommend that you evaluate and compare these selected platforms along three factors as listed below.

### **I. User Experience and Business ROI**

A chatbot or conversational AI agent is meant to scale out human
engagements with a target audience (e.g., universities with
prospective and existing students) through a conversation. A key
criterion to evaluate a chatbot platform is to assess how well a
chatbot engages with a user and delivers satisfactory user experience
as well as maximize business ROI, such as improving prospective
student conversion and existing student retention rate. When
evaluating how well a chatbot option can deliver satisfactory user
experience and business ROI, you want to compare available chatbot
options on the following aspects: 

* How well can a chatbot drive an empathetic and
  productive two-way conversation?

* How well can a chatbot deeply understand the psychographic
  characteristics (e.g., interests, unspoken needs, and personality)
  of its users from the conversations and use such insights to
  personalize machine or human advices?

### **II. Time to Value and Cost of Ownership**

If not careful, investing in a chatbot solution could become a
nightmare as if investing in a bottomless pit that requires constant
new investments (e.g., time and money) but with little return
of value. To avoid the pitfalls, it is important to deep dive into
chatbot options and compare the following:

* How much AI training do I need to do up front to teach a
  chatbot before it can function and deliver value for me?

* What kind of customizations are supported?

* What resources are required to do the customization (e.g., non-IT subject
  matter experts, dedicated IT personnel, or professional services)?

* How long will it take to make all the customizations? 

* How do I test, iteratively improve, and deploy a chatbot solution?
  How easy and fast can I do this? 

* What kind of reporting and analytics are available for me to access?
  Are they real-time data?

* How can I monitor and maintain or upgrade my chatbot? Will the
  maintanence or upgrades interrupt ongoing conversations?

### **III. Enterprise-Scale Adaptibility and Extensibility**

When an organization adopts a chatbot solution, it is often the case
that the organization wishes to build upon the current solution and
support new users of the chatbot. Thus it is important to evaluate
whether such a solution can be easily and quickly adapted to support
new tasks or be extended to support multiple tasks. For example, when
an educational institute starts with a chatbot solution to support
student recruitment, it may want to extend the chatbot to help
prospective students in their application process. Likewise, the
educational institute may want to add additional chatbots to help
student retention or alumni engagement. To evaluate how quickly and
easily a chatbot solution can be easily extended or reused in whole or
partially to support new tasks, ask the following:

* How quickly and easily can I reuse and adapt an existing chatbot to support a new task?

* How quickly and easily can I reuse and adapt an existing chatbot to
  support multiple tasks?

* How can I reuse just part of a chatbot (e.g., Q&A only) in another
  chatbot?

* How can I connect a chatbot to external resources, such as CMS or CRM system?

* How can I extend a chatbot with external functions (e.g., my own
  algorithms or third-party functions such as language translations)?

* How can I white-label a chatbot or embed a chatbot into my
  propreitary solutions?


## **Build Your Own Chatbot Comparison Table**

To help your Round-2 evaluation of multiple chatbot options, we have
created a set of detailed comparison criteria by the 3 factors
mentioned above:

* [User Experience and Business
ROI](#i-user-experience-and-business-roi)

* [Time to Value and Cost of Ownership](#ii-time-to-value-and-cost-of-ownership)

* [Enterprise-Scale Adaptability and
Extensibility](#iii-enterprise-scale-adaptibility-and-extensibility)


For your convenience, we list all the evaluation dimensions in a
table below, supplemented with concrete examples wherever possible to
help explain each evaluation dimension. While we use building an
educational chatbot solution as an example, the evaluation criteria
should be broadly applicable for building any chatbot solutions.

You can also [download the comparison template in an Excel
file](../files/Compare-Chatbot-Options-Template.xlsx) to build your
own comparison sheet and evaluate different chatbot options by
checking off each dimension for each chatbot option.
