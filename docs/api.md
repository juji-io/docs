# Juji API 

The Juji Cognitive AI infrastructure consists of two core cognitive AI
engines: **Psychographic Insights Engine** and **Cognitive AI Chat
Engine**, both of which are **domain and industry
independent**. Developers can use Juji API to access both Juji
engines and build their own cognitive AI
applications in **any domain and industry**.

## [Juji Psychographic Insights API](psychographic-api.md)

The Juji Psychographic Insights API enables developers to access the
Juji Psychographic Insights Engine, analyzing any text generated by a
person, such as social media posts, blogs, emails, voice transcripts,
and chat text, to automatically infer this person's quantitative human
trait scores. Currently, Juji infers trait scores of 100+ human trait
models, including fundamental human personality models (e.g., [Big 5
traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits))
and composite psychographic models (e.g., [Holland
Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Codes)).

Juji psychographic inference engine enables the discovery of diverse
human innate psychographic characteristics from text originated in
**any applications, domains or industries**. Moreover, Juji-inferred
human characteristics are typically persisted over a long period of
time and are shown to be effective at [predicting human real-world
behavior](https://www.yahoo.com/now/juji-inc-powers-auburn-led-143000709.html).

Thus the Juji Psychographic Insights API enables developers to build a
wide range of applications across diverse domains or industries, which
can automatically derive psychographic insights of a target audience
and use the discovered insights to predict or guide audience behavior:

* financial applications that auto-assess lenders' personality traits
and recommend suitable financial products.

* educational applications that auto-discover students'
psychologic needs and learning style to match-make students with
mentors.

* talent management applications that can auto-infer the soft skills
and moral characters of police candidates to determine their fit for a
police job role.

## [Juji Cognitive AI Chat API](cognitive-ai-chatbot-api.md)

While the Juji Psychographic Insights API enables developers to
discover people's unique psychographic characteristics from text,
developers may want to build end-to-end applications that can generate
data (i.e., user text) for deriving user psychographic insights as well
as employ the derived psychographic insights to achieve specific goals
(e.g., aiding users in their decision making).

Juji Cognitive AI Chat API enables developers to access the Juji
Cognitive AI Chat engine and rapidly build an **end-to-end** cognitive
AI assistant in a form of chatbot in **any domain or
industry**. Developers can also use the API to deploy their chatbot in
multiple forms, includng in a text chat window on a website, a
third-party mobile application, or an embodied AI agent.

While developers can use the Juji Psychographic API and the Juji
Cognitive Chat API independent of each other, we strongly encourage
developers to use the two sets of API together to maximize the ROI of
a cognitive AI application. For example, developers can use the Juji
Cognitive Chat API to rapidly create an AI chatbot that will gather
user data naturally in a chat and feeds the data to Juji Psychographic
API for analysis. The analysis results, user psychographics, can then
be used by the chatbot to deliver hyper-personalized guidance.


## Authentication

Most Juji API endpoints requires authentication. Two types of authentication are supported.

### JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

This authentication is based on JWT (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token).

Once you have created an account at https://juji.ai/signup, to authenticate to the API, supply your email and password to the `authenticate` GraphQL mutation and request the `token` field in the response, e.g.

```graphql
mutation
  authenticate($input: AuthenticateInput!) {
    authenticate(input: $input) {
      token
    }
  }
```
where the variable input should be a JSON object with `email` and `password` fields.

If successful, a JSON object is returned with a token, e.g.
```json
{
  data: {
    authenticate: {
      token: "a very long random looking string"
    }
  }
}
```

For all subsequent API calls, add the returned token in the `Authorization` header of the request with the string `Bearer ` prefixed to the token. For example, if the returned token was `abc` then the `Authorization` header would be `Bearer abc`.

Note that all API calls must be made over HTTPS and that as of now, the returned token is valid for up to 10 hours.

### API KEY Authentication

API key can be used as a long lasting token for autentication. Once you obtained the key, you can used it for years. So it is useful if you want to build some integration with Juji on your product. 

To obtain the API key, you will need to do the following:

1. Log in to your Juji account on juji.io
2. In the dashboard, click the top right button and select Account
  <p align="center"><img src="../img/visit-account-page.png" alt="Visit Account Page" width="650px"/></p>
3. In the Account page, select "APIKEY" then select "Generate New API Key" to get one
  <p align="center"><img src="../img/generate-new-api-key.png" alt="Generate New API Key" width="650px"/></p>
4. Copy the generated API key somewhere secure and don't tell anyone :) Note that you will only see the API key on Juji website once. If you lost it, you will need to generate a new one.
  <p align="center"><img src="../img/generated-api-key-example.png" alt="Generated API Key Example" width="650px"/></p>

Once you have the API key, you can use the basic auth method to authenticate your API calls. Use "apikey" as the username and your API key as the password. Below is an example in Postman:
<p align="center"><img src="../img/postman-api-key-example.png" alt="Postman API Key Example" width="650px"/></p>
In cURL you can use `-u` or `--header`:

```
-u 'apikey:cd177690b1e3484b8c3d3e0e27bce4a2'

--header 'Authorization: Basic YXBpa2V5OmNkMTc3NjkwYjFlMzQ4NGI4YzNkM2UwZTI3YmNlNGEy'
```

## Domain Nouns

To effectively leverage Juji API, it is useful to understand the data schema of Juji platform. Juji data is organized with the following domain nouns.

### Brand

A brand is synonymous to an organization.

### Engagement

An engagement is a chatbot project created under a brand.

### REP

REP is abbreviation for Responsible Empathetic Persona. It is the identity of
a chatbot, with a name and a personality. Each engagement has a REP.

### Release

A release represents a versioned deployment of one engagement.
Thus an engagement may have multiple releases. This allows you to refine your
bot without impacting your production release.

### Script

Each release is associated with a corresponding script in [REP Language](../reference/). The script is identified by a unique namespace. The namespace has a format `<brand-name>.<engX>.<rep-name>`, where `X` is the sequence number of the engagement, e.g. `mycorp.eng3.kaya`

### Question

REP often asks questions in a chat. Each question is associated with the namespace in
which it resides, as well as a question id that is unique in that namespace.

### Participation

A participation represents one instance of a conversation by an end user with a REP.
A participation is always associated with a release.

### Answer

Each end users answer to REP's question is recorded, along with the participation
in which the question is answered.
