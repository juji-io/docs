The main differences between non-AI and AI chatbots are

chat, and personalize such engagements. If you are still unsure which
type of chatbot you need, you can use the following quick test to
determine whether you need an AI chatbot.

* Do you want your chatbot to interact with your audience, e.g.,
  answering user free-text questions any time during a chat?

  user paths that are difficult to numerate or anticipate?

  interactions and handle exceptions gracefully?

* Do you want your chatbot to learn insights of your audience from a chat and
  use such insights to help them in the chat?
