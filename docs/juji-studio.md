# **Juji Studio Reference Guide**

Juji Studio provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for
non-IT professionals or <b><i>anyone</b></i> to
rapidly create, customize, test, deploy, and manage AI chatbots with **#NOCODE** or IT support. Born with advanced human soft skills (<a href="https://juji.io/#juji-smarts">cognitive intelligence</a>), such a chatbot can automate human-human interactions at scale and accomplish non-trivial tasks empathetically and responsibly.

##Your Home Screen

###Create a Chatbot

When you login to Juji Studio the first time, below is what your "home screen" looks like. This is also where all your chatbots will be listed.

### Manage a Chatbot

Once you create a chatbot, the chatbot will show up on this "home screen". You can edit the chatbot's content or behavior as well as test the chatbot by clicking on the **Manage** button.

<p align="center"><img src="../img/juji-studio/manage-a-chatbot.png" alt="Juji Studio Signon page" width="650px"/></p>

You can also click on the ellipsis icon (three dots) on the top right corner of the chatbot card, and perform additional management actions on that chatbot, such as **export**, **import**, **clone**, and **delete**. When you import a chatbot into another chatbot, it means that you wish to replace the chatbot's main chat flow or Q&A list with that of another chatbot.

**Design Tip** Importing a chatbot into another chatbot is most useful when you want to share multi-turn Q&As among different chatbots. The typical Q&A CSV list cannot capture the content and logic of multi-turn Q&As, which can be exported with a chatbot and then be imported into another chatbot. See [customization of Q&A](./customize-qa)
