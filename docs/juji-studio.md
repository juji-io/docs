Juji Studio provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for
non-IT professionals or <b><i>anyone</b></i> to
rapidly create, customize, test, deploy, and manage AI chatbots with **#NOCODE** or IT support. Born with advanced human soft skills (<a href="https://juji.io/#juji-smarts">cognitive intelligence</a>), such a chatbot can automate human-human interactions at scale and accomplish non-trivial tasks empathetically and responsibly.
