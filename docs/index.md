# **Introduction: The Juji Platform**

The Juji platform enables you to rapidly and easily create, launch,
and manage powerful, custom Juji AI assistants in the form of chatbots
with built-in cognitive intelligence. Such intelligence enables your
chatbot to interpret highly diverse and complex user natural language
expressions, analyze user sentiment, manage complex and critical
conversations empathically by actively listening to its users, and
infer users' personality characteristics from a conversation.

Juji AI assistants engage users in text-based, natural language
conversations to accomplish a wide variety of tasks across domains,
such as greeting users on your website to answer user inquiries about
your online offerings and guide user actions as well as keeping users
engaged in long-term activities in your mobile app.

Because training powerful AI chatbots requires deep AI expertise,
sophisticated programming, not to mention large amounts of training
data and intensive computational resources, Juji has also made its
platform **accessible** by enabling non-IT professionals to create,
launch, and manage custom cognitive AI chatbots with no code and no IT
resources required. In other words, Juji handles the heavy lifting for
you, so you can focus on the structure and writing of the human-AI
conversation, and the personality of your chatbot.

The Juji Platform is made up of three main components, which provides both the convenience and flexibility for an organization to build and manage its cognitive AI chatbots.

  **[Juji Studio](juji-studio)** supports **end-to-end**, **NO-CODE**
  design, development, and management of cognitive AI chatbots. It
  provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for
  **everyone**, with or without technical skills or AI knowledge, to
  rapidly create, customize, test, deploy, and manage AI chatbots with
  no code or IT resources required. It automatically generates and
  manages the conversation flow of an AI chatbot including
  auto-handling arbitrary user interruptions based on the conversation
  topics specified by a human designer. Juji Studio also provides a
  conversation library with a rich set of pre-built AI chatbot assets,
  including AI chatbot templates, conversation topics, and
  domain-specific Q&A templates.

  **[Juji IDE](juji-ide)** enables people with minimal coding skills (e.g.,
  ability to write HTML) to power AI chatbots with advanced capabilities (e.g.,
  customizing product recommendation policies). It provides an
  interactive development environment that allows chatbot developers
  to write, compile, and preview AI chatbots using a high-level, [chatbot
  scripting language](reference). So you don't even have to be a nerd to use the IDE, just someone with an intermediate level of understanding of simple computer language. These days a good chunk of peeps can handle the IDE pretty well. That means even the most complex of Juji's elements is probably less complex than the 'basic' chatbot engines of some of our more illustrious competitors.  

  **[Juji API](api)** enables **application developers** (e.g., someone
    who is familiar with Javascript or Python) to embed Juji AI
    chatbots in different applications (e.g., mobile or web-based
    applications). While Juji Studio supports the rapid creation and
    customization of an AI chatbot, [Juji
    API](https://docs.juji.io/api/) allows rapid and easy integration
    of such a chatbot into third-party applications. With our
    rock-solid API Juji bots can be integrated just about anywhere.

## **Get Started on Juji**

Getting started on Juji is very easy. Most of the time the "10 minute chatbot" is a damaging delusion. But not with Juji. The reason is simple. Every Juji bot already has every part of Juji's extensive libraries and world beating functionalities available to it even if you just start it by saying, Oh, I don't know, let's shoot for something original like "Hello world". In other words, to get you to the first ten minute bot that actually works, took us years of work.

The visuals below summarize the key steps to creating and deploying
your first AI chatbot on Juji **in just a few minutes**. And this time it's not BS.
