# **Design AI Chatbot**


## Create Your First AI Chatbot

To create your very first chatbot, you have two ways of doing it. One way is to create a new chatbot from scratch using one of the Juji chatbot templates; the other way is to import an existing Juji chatbot. 

### Create a new chatbot from scratch

Just click on the "+" button to create a new chatbot.

#### <b>Select a chatbot deployment channel</b>
Juji currently supports two direct deployment channels: Facebook Messenger and a website. Because each channel may support different custom chatbot messages, you will choose a channel to start. If you do not know which channel you will use yet, we suggest that you choose the web channel as it is most generic.

#### <b>Select a chatbot template</b>
Juji provides a set of task-specific templates that can be used to create a chatbot. If you wish to start with a clean slate, you also have the option of selecting the blank template, which includes only a <b>Welcome</b> message and a <b>Wrap-up</b> message, leaving the main chat flow empty for further customization.

**General Chatbot Templates.** Juji templates are organized by domains. If a template is domain agnostic, it is considered a general template. For example, the templates that can be used for conducting conversational surveys or product marketing are placed under the "General" category.

**HR (Talent Management) Chatbot Templates.** Juji provides three sets of domain-specific templates. One domain is talent management for Human Resources (HR). This set of templates covers the whole spectrum of talent management, from talent recruitment, talent engagement, to talent development.

**Education Chatbot Templates.** The second domain that Juji covers is education and learning, covering the whole student lifecycle, from student recruitment, onboarding, to learning and assessment.

**Healthcare Chatbot Templates.** The third domain that Juji covers is healthcare, covering various telehealth tasks, such as patient triage and engagement (check in).

Before choosing a chatbot template, you can always preview sample chats produced by the template by clicking on the "eye" icon associated with each template.

Once you select a template to create a chatbot, you will be able to preview the chatbot or customize the created chatbot immediately. See more below on how to customize a chatbot.

### Import a Juji chatbot

Instead of creating one from scratch, you can use the "import" button to import an existing Juji chatbot.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/juji-studio/juji-studio-import-chatbot.png" alt="Juji Studio Import a Chatbot" width="650px"/></p>

An existing Juji chatbot is stored in a file with a file extension .juji. Here is how you can [export a Juji chatbot](../../chatbot-design-tips-advanced/#2-exportimport-juji-chatbots) to share with others or with a different Juji account.

## Customize AI Chatbot
Once a chatbot is created or imported, a chatbot creator can use Juji Studio to customize the chatbot from three aspects:

### **Customize Main Chat Flow**

Just like a human assistant, every AI chatbot on Juji has a <b>"playbook"</b>, which contains a workflow and drives the chatbot to take actions. This "playbook" is defined as the *main chat flow* in Juji Studio, also known as the conversation agenda. A typical flow threads one or more conversation topics to drive a conversation forward. A chatbot template contains a pre-built flow and a creator can customize such a flow by adding, removing, and editing a topic in the flow. [<b>Read More</b>](../customize-main-chat-flow).

### **Customize Q&A and Fallback**

AI chatbots should be able to answer user inquiries or respond to user
comments *any time* during a chat. To enable such capabilities,
a chatbot creator can add, remove, and edit a Q&A list and
fallback handling as shown below. [<b>Read More</b>](../customize-qa)

### **Customize Chatbot Persona and Beyond**

A chatbot creator may also want to customize the chatbot persona as
well as other chat-related settings, such as controlling the pace of a
chat. [<b>Read More</b>](../customize-persona-beyond)


## Test AI Chatbot

One can test a chatbot easily by clicking on the "Preview" button. This allows a chatbot creator to interact with the chatbot, testing how the chatbot works immediately and what improvements may be needed.

## What's Next

Once a chatbot is ready, you can deploy it onto a website or a
Facebook page. Please check out [**Chatbot Deployment**](../release)
to deploy your AI chatbot.
